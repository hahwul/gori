# Changelog

## v0.1.3

- Fix 30 confirmed bugs found across three build-and-dogfood passes: TUI (`--db`, Repeater NUL-truncated bodies, Rewriter hot-reload, Sequencer/Miner/OAST, Scope reload, log redirection), CLI (`oast listen --help` crash, Issues/Sitemap export encoding), proxy (WS close-handshake race, h2 preface on intercept), MCP, Import (HAR/OpenAPI/URL-list CRLF injection), Fuzzer auto-calibration, and more (#301, #307, #310)
- CLI: accept `-V` as a version flag alias (#298)
- TUI: match banner and wordmark gold to the real logo (#308)
- Docs: dynamic landing page, nav/sidebar reorganization, logo download menu, homepage title (#300, #302, #303, #304, #305, #306, #309)

## v0.1.2

- MCP: start **unbound** outside a Git workspace so `gori mcp --install-*` always connects; agents bind via `list_projects` / `create_project` / `switch_project`. Traffic tools return `NO_PROJECT` until bound, and `--no-project` forces unbound inside a workspace (#295)
- TUI: show a startup update-available notice on the project picker (#293)
- TUI: make the NOR/INS editor mode badge more discoverable with click-to-toggle (#294)
- TUI: fix clickable OAST callbacks, pane navigation, and Rewriter preview (#296)
- Tests: expand spec coverage across pure and harness-testable modules (#297)

## v0.1.1

- Fix wide-character/emoji rendering and caret placement in the TUI editors with a per-grapheme width model (#281, #285, #289, #291)
- Fix proxy self-loop guards under wildcard binds, serve the CA cert page to LAN clients, and show a dialable bind address (#279, #284, #287)
- Stop background reconcile from resetting the caret in Repeater and Notes (#277, #286)
- Add Snap packaging and publish workflow (#276)
- Docs: install command picker, sidebar regrouping, AI setup guide, landing refresh (#275, #282, #283, #288, #290)
