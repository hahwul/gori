# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Miss Ring: a wider range of faces, out of the two glyphs she already wore. Her lashes are now an expression axis rather than a fixed pair — ´ and ` point inward for the soft, open resting face, turn over for a furrowed one, and lean the same way for a single cocked brow — so four new poses (a curious `oh?`, a knowing half-smile, a narrow-eyed `hmm`, a sulk with the mouth cup turned over) cost no new glyph and no new cell, and the error face gets the furrowed brows it always wanted. Reactions became arcs instead of single frames: a mood is held three to five seconds, which is fifteen to twenty-five beats of an identical sprite, so she now hits the peak on the beat the result lands and settles into a quieter cousin of it 1.6s later — beams then smiles, tenses then considers, recoils then stares. The idle gestures went from four to seven and from one per 75 seconds to one per 25: she dozes off after 90 seconds, so at the old rate an operator who stepped away saw a single gesture per waking spell and the table might as well have had one entry in it. Seven and not more because the table is bounded by what her OPENING can show — the schedule is a pure hash of a beat counter that starts at 0 in every process, so the first firings are the same fixed sequence for every user, and a spec pins that they cover the whole table; at eight scripts only four choice-salts in a thousand cover it, and at nine none do. Everything is still in the five cavity cells, so the status-bar chip shows all of it, and the repaint budget is unchanged at ~22% of beats

## v0.3.1

- Filters: one query grammar on every filter surface, content terms included; `header:`/`body:` now take a side, and the filter bar teaches its own syntax (#668, #674)
- Decoder: recognize GraphQL/gRPC bodies by media-type essence, decode HTML entities, and cover WS subscriptions and both-side protobuf (#663)
- Probe: scan binary WebSocket frames for credential shapes, stop DOM-XSS pairing on shapes that carry no taint, and fix two rule gates that failed silently (#671, #672, #676)
- TUI: a copy key in INS mode (`y` there types a `y`), a wrap-lines toggle with horizontal scrolling back, sandbox togglable from the palette, and a deeper brand gold in the light theme (#652, #657, #670, #677, #680)
- Performance: chunked imports, a fast path for parked TLS sockets, cheaper discover fingerprinting, n-ary miner bisection, probe findings in one writer round-trip, and probe lists paged in SQL (#655, #665, #666, #667, #669, #673, #675)
- Stability: ~40 ways gori could crash, hang, overrun a stop or lose a run's results; an MCP server that survives the three things that killed it; project delete/`--db`/durable-write and intercept ack fixes (#651, #654, #658, #659, #678, #679)
- Docs: a Playbooks section that teaches gori's workflows by doing them, AUTOMATION split into Run and MCP with a new Scripting guide, and a refreshed landing hero (#650, #664, #682)

## v0.3.0

### New features

- Colormarker: a new tab for row-colour rules in History — global and project scope, custom colours defined, recoloured and renamed in place, reorder, painted consistently across TUI/CLI/MCP (#632, #640)
- Cookie workbench: parse, verify, brute-force, and forge Flask, Rack, and Django session cookies (#569)
- HTTP/2, first-class: hold, edit and drop individual streams at intercept, a complete HPACK encoder, Match&Replace on h2 heads, a per-stream sandbox, and a field-native send path for the shapes h1 head text cannot express (#510, #512, #513, #515, #649)
- WebSocket: Match & Replace over messages, and hold/edit/drop at intercept with `proto:ws` (#500, #533, #537)
- Session bindings: extract a value from proxy traffic once, resolve `$NAME` from it at send time (#501, #530, #535)
- Proxy: reverse-proxy listener mode, transparent listeners that read the kernel's original destination, and a short-circuit rule op that answers a request without dialing upstream (#509, #520, #528)
- Decoder: schema-less protobuf/gRPC wire decoder, new encodings (quoted-printable, punycode, base36/62, xml/shell/c escapes, homoglyph/typo), saved chains callable by name, and a named library with a picker (#505, #558, #567)
- Fuzzer: built-in payload preset sets (SQLi and more), selectable across TUI/CLI/MCP (#568)
- OAST: blind SSRF — plant a payload, promote the finding when the target calls home (#609)
- Export: HAR export, with the import-side fields to round-trip it (#506)
- Miss Ring: an opt-in companion in the body's corner, and on the project picker delivering the update notice; on `lively` she now also plays one of four idle gestures — a yawn, a smile, a squint or a deadpan — about once a minute, in the status-bar chip as well as the body sprite (#474, #548, #550)

### Changes

- Discover: read the target's well-known documents (OIDC/OAuth discovery, `security.txt`, sitemaps, …) and extract endpoints from JS bundles, JSON, source maps and inline `<script>`; keep each finding's request/response and open them from the findings table; hold and re-measure a drifting soft-404 baseline instead of reporting hundreds of limiter hits; report a real page on a wildcard-200 origin; bound per-response spend and stop a JS literal from buying a brute-force sweep (#605, #638)
- Comparer: per-row change highlighting with `n`/`⇧N` navigation and `f` fold, per-column `status·size·time` headers with the A→B delta, and **Send to Comparer** from the Repeater, Sitemap and Fuzzer rows; `--context=N` fold parity in CLI/MCP
- Rewriter: rules scoped global or project (replacing the s/o preset library), shown on the tab bar by default right of Comparer (#544, #611)
- Probe: passive-rule improvements, the OAST SSRF rule classed CWE-918, and a navigable AFFECTED URLS list in a finding
- Miner: latency-bound scheduling — one work queue for all locations, parallel calibration (~2.4x)
- JWT: the lens switch (`^T`) now shows on the pane it acts on; new `dancheong` (dark) and `hanji` (light) themes
- Project picker: multi-select over the project list — `Tab` / `⇧Tab` mark and step, `⇧↑` / `⇧↓` extend a range, `ctrl-a` marks everything the search shows, `esc` clears. The space menu's **Delete** then acts on the marks if any are set, else the cursor row; it names what it is about to wipe, says how much of the set the current search is hiding, and keeps (rather than silently skips) a project another gori still has open
- `gori ca`: reject a flag written before the verb, repair a CA directory missing one of the key/cert pair, and reject an Ed25519/Ed448 or mismatched-key root with an operator-legible message instead of failing at the first CONNECT
- Fixes: bracketed-paste freeze and poison in the Repeater; the `--` separator dropping subcommand args across ~60 `gori run` sites; colormarker custom-colour persistence and reorder writes; clipboard OSC 52 over tty; project-settings and host-override reload/rollback audit; OAST partial-poll evidence loss; and many dogfood-surfaced bugs

## v0.2.0

- Proxy: upstream connection rules with per-host routing, SOCKS5 and proxy auth; a TLS pass-through list that is never MITM'd; per-destination outbound TLS (client certificates, protocol floor, ciphers); a setting to force HTTP/1.1; transparent listeners and additional listeners alongside the primary bind (#434, #435, #436, #437, #438)
- Proxy: harden the HTTP/2 assembler against CONTINUATION spoofing and stream-slot exhaustion, re-sync framing after a head rewrite so Match&Replace can't smuggle, and reject bare-CR header obfuscation and ambiguous response framing (#341, #403, #409, #412, #417)
- Proxy: serve the CA-download page at a reserved host, `gori.proxy` (#347)
- TUI: multi-select in History, the Intercept queue, the Sitemap tree, and the Issues list, so the space menu acts on N items at once (#442, #459, #460, #461)
- TUI: the Project tab becomes sub-tabs instead of five tiled panes, Network settings gain upstream-rules and outbound-TLS tables, a Keys section picks the command modifier (⌥ reaches the shortcuts Ctrl can't), plus `rosepine` and `tokyonight_day` themes (#440, #454, #458, #462, #463)
- TUI: export the current note to Markdown from the Notes space menu, and ask where to write the Issues report instead of always overwriting `<project dir>/issues.{md,json}`. Export is `⇧E` on both tabs; the Issues list's old `x` is freed, so `x` now means "Select line" everywhere (#432)
- Settings: `--config PATH` plus settings export/import profiles, per-project connect/idle timeouts and capture limit, and a unified retention policy (#439, #440, #441, #448, #450, #455)
- Import: read Postman collections, Insomnia exports, and Burp XML (#453)
- Probe: active-scan rules for open redirect, CRLF/response-header injection, host-header injection, access-control bypass, NGINX-style parameter traversal, GraphQL introspection, SSTI, and Next.js server-action missing authorization; passive rules for JWT weaknesses, source maps, SRI, and directory listing; a manual unsafe-method opt-in and AGGRESSIVE mode (#299, #342, #343, #346, #349, #350, #451)
- CLI/MCP: bring `gori run` and `gori mcp` to TUI parity, and create/delete projects from `gori run project` (#351, #352)
- Performance: move trigram FTS indexing off the capture commit path, and reuse one HTTP/1.1 connection across a fuzz sweep (up to 20x on HTTPS) (#428, #433)
- Security: close request-splicing and scope-gate holes across Discover, Fuzzer, Repeater and Scope — crawled-link splicing, unvalidated redirect `Location`, per-URL probe authorization, fail-open scope, irregular request-line whitespace, and `wss://` targets dialing cleartext (#390-#397, #404-#407, #418-#422)
- Security: keep gori's own files owner-only — the CA private key is now 0600 from creation (it used to land at the umask default and get chmod'd a syscall later, and a key that got loose any other way was never re-tightened) and is re-asserted on every load, and a settings export carrying a secret is written 0600. `--config` and `--ca-dir` no longer re-mode a directory the operator merely named (#466, #467)
- Say what went wrong instead of swallowing it: a TUI session that can't open (a bad `--db`, an unreadable store) reports why on the project picker rather than dropping the operator on "no projects yet"; an unparseable `settings.json` says it is falling back to defaults rather than resetting the bind, upstream rules and TLS pass-through list in silence; and a path that should be a directory but isn't (`--ca-dir notes.txt`) is named as such instead of surfacing as `BIO_new_file(...) failed` or a raw backtrace
- Refactor: a single outbound chokepoint for the active-traffic scope gate, one Plan builder per engine (fuzz, discover, miner, repeater, sequencer) shared by TUI/CLI/MCP, and all 28 TUI modals on one Overlay seam (#354, #355, #356, #361)
- Packaging and docs: Nix flake with an update channel, `AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md` with the P0-P8 principles, and an install script that survives GitHub API rate limits (#338, #345, #353, #360, #429)

## v0.1.4

- Proxy: fix HTTPS blank pages / empty History — reflect origin ALPN so h1-only origins load, resolve the system CA trust store for upstream verification, and report TLS-verify failures separately from connect failures (#332, #333, #334, #336)
- Proxy: stop an upstream RST leaving a flow stuck Pending forever (#330)
- Scope-gate every outbound path so Sandbox mode holds: Repeater, Fuzzer, Miner, Sequencer (CLI and TUI), with `--allow-unscoped` opt-out (#322, #330, #339)
- Import: reject CR/LF/NUL smuggling in HAR/OpenAPI, and neutralize control bytes in decoder/JWT text output (#322, #324, #339)
- CLI/MCP parity: add Comparer (`gori run compare` / `compare_flows`), CLI Intercept, CLI WS repeater send, MCP scope/env/host-override mutation and `import_flows`, `gori run probe --active` (#321, #326)
- MCP: fix a credential leak in `get_repeater_context`, cap unbounded h1 capture reads, and surface `PROJECT_BUSY` on rolled-back writes (#335)
- TUI: Repeater `^N` mirrors the target host into the Host header, Fuzzer wordlist field suggests recent and favorited paths, tutorial navigation fixes (#314, #315, #335)
- OAST: support global-scope providers alongside project scope (#313)
- Fix dogfooding-surfaced bugs across QL (`url:`, size and `dur:` units, uppercase schemes), Discover, Sequencer, Repeater, browser CA trust warning, `settings.json` formatting, and multipart form data (#312, #316, #317, #318, #319, #325, #337)

## v0.1.3

- Fix 30 confirmed bugs found across three build-and-dogfood passes: TUI (`--db`, Repeater NUL-truncated bodies, Rewriter hot-reload, Sequencer/Miner/OAST, Scope reload, log redirection), CLI (`oast listen --help` crash, Issues/Sitemap export encoding), proxy (WS close-handshake race, h2 preface on intercept), MCP, Import (HAR/OpenAPI/URL-list CRLF injection), Fuzzer auto-calibration, and more (#301, #307, #310)
- CLI: accept `-V` as a version flag alias (#298)
- TUI: match banner and wordmark gold to the real logo (#308)
- Docs: dynamic landing page, nav/sidebar reorganization, logo download menu, homepage title (#300, #302, #303, #304, #305, #306, #309)

## v0.1.2

- MCP: start **unbound** outside a Git workspace so `gori mcp --install-*` always connects; agents bind via `list_projects` / `create_project` / `switch_project`. Traffic tools return `NO_PROJECT` until bound, and `--no-project` forces unbound inside a workspace (#295)
- TUI: show a startup update-available notice on the project picker (#293)
- TUI: make the NOR/INS editor mode badge more discoverable with click-to-toggle (#294)
- TUI: fix clickable OAST callbacks, pane navigation, and Rewriter preview (#296)
- Tests: expand spec coverage across pure and harness-testable modules (#297)

## v0.1.1

- Fix wide-character/emoji rendering and caret placement in the TUI editors with a per-grapheme width model (#281, #285, #289, #291)
- Fix proxy self-loop guards under wildcard binds, serve the CA cert page to LAN clients, and show a dialable bind address (#279, #284, #287)
- Stop background reconcile from resetting the caret in Repeater and Notes (#277, #286)
- Add Snap packaging and publish workflow (#276)
- Docs: install command picker, sidebar regrouping, AI setup guide, landing refresh (#275, #282, #283, #288, #290)
