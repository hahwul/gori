# Changelog

## v0.1.2

- MCP: start **unbound** outside a Git workspace so `gori mcp --install-*` always connects; agents bind via `list_projects` / `create_project` / `switch_project`. Traffic tools return `NO_PROJECT` until bound, and `--no-project` forces unbound inside a workspace (#295)
- TUI: show a startup update-available notice on the project picker (#293)
- TUI: make the NOR/INS editor mode badge more discoverable with click-to-toggle (#294)
- TUI: fix clickable OAST callbacks, pane navigation, and Rewriter preview (#296)
- Tests: expand spec coverage across pure and harness-testable modules (#297)

## v0.1.1

- Fix wide-character/emoji rendering and caret placement in the TUI editors with a per-grapheme width model (#281, #285, #289, #291)
- Fix proxy self-loop guards under wildcard binds, serve the CA cert page to LAN clients, and show a dialable bind address (#279, #284, #287)
- Stop background reconcile from resetting the caret in Repeater and Notes (#277, #286)
- Add Snap packaging and publish workflow (#276)
- Docs: install command picker, sidebar regrouping, AI setup guide, landing refresh (#275, #282, #283, #288, #290)
