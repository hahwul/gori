# TUI screenshots

The terminal screenshots in the docs (`docs/static/images/tui/*.svg`) are **real
captures** of the gori TUI, not hand-drawn mock-ups. They are rendered to
self-contained SVG so they stay crisp at any size, weigh a few KB, and carry
their own theme colours (they blend into the dark docs and read as a card on the
light theme).

## How it works

1. `capture.sh` spins up a throwaway project under a temp `GORI_HOME`, seeds it
   with real traffic (httpbin / github / example.com through the proxy), then
   drives a real TUI inside a `tmux` session and grabs each screen with
   `tmux capture-pane -e` (truecolor ANSI).
2. `ansi2svg.py` parses that ANSI into a cell grid and emits an SVG, placing each
   run of text with `textLength` + `lengthAdjust` so the monospace grid stays
   aligned regardless of the viewer's font. It auto-detects the theme's
   background, so light themes render correctly too.

Nothing here touches your real `~/.gori`.

## Regenerate

```bash
shards build                       # ensure ./bin/gori exists
docs/tools/tui-capture/capture.sh  # writes docs/static/images/tui/*.svg
```

Requirements: `bash`, `tmux`, `python3`, `curl`.

Captures are reproducible but not pixel-identical run to run (timestamps,
durations, and live response bodies vary), so eyeball the output before
committing. The theme gallery on the Themes page is shot by setting
`"theme":"<name>"` in the seeded `settings.json` and re-running the `history`
scene.

## Render a single frame by hand

```bash
tmux capture-pane -e -p > frame.ansi          # from any gori tmux session
python3 ansi2svg.py frame.ansi frame.svg --title "gori · History"
```
